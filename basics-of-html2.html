            <p>MERN stack is a software stack that includes four open-source technologies: (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
               These components provide an end-to-end framework for building dynamic web sites and web applications.</p>

            <p>Among these technologies MongoDB is a database system, Node.js is a server-side runtime environment, Express.js is a
               web framework for Node.js and React is a client-side JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.Because all 
                components of the MERN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, MERN applications can be written 
                in one programming language for both server-side and client-side execution environments</p>

       <h1>FESTIVALS IN INDIA</h1>
        
         <p>A festival is an event ordinarily celebrated by a community and centering on some characteristic aspect
             of that community and its religion or cultures. It is often marked as a local or 
           national holiday, mela, or eid. A festival constitutes typical cases of glocalization, as well 
        as the high culture-low culture interrelationship.[1] Next to religion and folklore, a significant 
        origin is agricultural. Food is such a vital resource that many festivals are associated with harvest time.
          Religious commemoration and thanksgiving for good harvests are blended in events that take place in autumn, 
           such as Halloween in the northern hemisphere and Easter in the southern.</p>

        <p>Festivals often serve to fulfill specific communal purposes, especially in regard to commemoration or
            thanking to the gods, goddesses or saints: they're called patronal festivals. They may also provide
             entertainment, which was particularly important to local communities before the advent 
            of mass-produced entertainment. Festivals that focus on cultural or ethnic topics also 
           seek to inform community members of their traditions; the involvement of elders sharing
            stories and experience provides a means for unity among families.</p>

               <h1>BACHELOR OF TECHNOLOGY</h1>
                  <p>A Bachelor of Technology (Latin Baccalaureus Technologiae, commonly abbreviated as B.Tech. or BTech;
                    with honours as B.Tech. (Hons.)) is an undergraduate academic degree conferred after the completion of a 
                 three-year, a four-year or a five-year program of studies at an accredited university or accredited
                 university-level institution. The degree is conferred in several countries, including the
                 Commonwealth of Nations, the United States and elsewhere.For admissions, the most common BTech
                entrance examinations are JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Along with these national level entrance 
                examinations, there are many state and private level entrance examinations that the students 
                 can attempt for admission to the course. The basic eligibility criteria for BTech is class 12 
                 Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics. However, there are additional criteria in every
               entrance exam and institute. Some of the institutes also conduct admission to their courses
               on merit basis i.e. based on marks scored by candidates in their class 12 board exam</p>
